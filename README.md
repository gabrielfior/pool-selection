### Take home challenge

# Further work if given enough time


- Check if e-mail had been already registered, hence updating the deposits (currently, if e-mail already exists, the entry gets updated)
- Feedback on HTML not optimal (full-fledged frontend application would be more beautiful)
- Better error handling (naive implementation of toasts but nothing too amazing)
- API being called too often -> would have stored values in a DB and have a job update it frequently
- Inform the user of the datetime of the last update
